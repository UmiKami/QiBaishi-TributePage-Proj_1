          Qi Baishi (Chinese, 1864–1957) is considered the most popular painter
          in 20th century China. Born in Hunan Province, he painted in a
          traditional Chinese style, despite having no formal training in
          painting or calligraphy. Qi is best known for his works featuring
          flowers, trees, and small animals, such as birds, mice and shrimp.
          During the 1900s, Qi made his first trips to Shanghai, where he was
          significantly influenced by the Shanghai School and the artist Wu
          Changshou (Chinese, 1843–1927). He moved to Beijing c.1918, and
          developed a friendship with the painter Chen Shizeng (Chinese,
          1876–1923), whose work further inspired Qi's own artistic style. While
          painting established Chinese themes free from Western influence, Qi
          distinguished himself by creating a prolific body of work featuring
          unique compositions and bold color schemes. His paintings are admired
          not only by Chinese citizens, but also by art scholars and
          international collectors. One of Qi's works sold at the China Guardian
          2011 Spring Auctions in Beijing for more than US$65 million.
